CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcostmap_converter_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "costmap_converter_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "costmap_converter_msgs" with any of the following names:

    costmap_converter_msgsConfig.cmake
    costmap_converter_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "costmap_converter_msgs" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "costmap_converter_msgs_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "costmap_converter_msgs" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
